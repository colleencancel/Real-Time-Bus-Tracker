Real Time Bus Tracker Project
MIT xPRO 

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course.

Description
This project displays a web page containing real time location information for a bus route in Cambridge, MA. This project demonstrates the ability to write async functions to fetch data from external sources. This project uses programmatic styling to build and render a map on a web page.

Improvements
There has been a change in the style of the Mapbox map

Installation

The map will load an appear in your browser. Click on the button for the marker to load and begin tracking the live bus.

Roadmap of future improvements
Track more than one bus at a time
Allow for other modes of transportation to be tracked
